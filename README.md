# KOSMO-POLY6-JACKS

This repository contains KICAD Schematics, PCB and front panel to build a 6 voice jack board for the "Polykit" Inspired 6 Channel Synth in Kosmo Format as inspired by Look Mum No Computer LMNK. The Jack board is intended as an output stage for the main DCO found here https://github.com/twinturbo/KOSMO-POLY6-PICO-DCO

Other modules in the line up are

- KOSMO-POLY6-PICO-DCO - Complete [ DCO ] (https://github.com/twinturbo/KOSMO-POLY6-PICO-DCO)
- KOSMO-POLY6-JACKS - Complete.
- KOSMO-POLY6-MIX - In design.
- KOSMO-POLY6-ADSR - In Production with JLCPCB.
- KOSMO-POLY6-VCA - In design.
- KOSMO-POLY6 Filter - (TBD).

## Key features

- 6 Jacks for Pulse Out ( normaled to the output header when not jacked )
- 6 Jacks for Ramp Out ( normaled to the output header when not jacked )
- 6 Jacks for Gate ( normaled to the output header when not jacked )
- +5v, +3.3v , +12V , -12V power pass through ( board itself is passive )

## Schematics and PCB
Schematics and PCB are in KICAD format.
